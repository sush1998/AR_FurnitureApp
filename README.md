# 🛋️ AR Furniture App – Augmented Reality Interior Design

This Android application leverages **Augmented Reality (AR)** to enhance interior design by allowing users to visualize and interact with 3D furniture and decor elements in their actual environment using a smartphone.

📝 **Published Research**:  
This project is supported by a research paper titled *"Augmented Reality Interior Design"*, published in the [International Journal of Advanced Science and Research Engineering Technology (IJASRET), October 2020](https://www.ijasret.com/VolumeArticles/FullTextPDF/421_6.AUGMENTED_REALITY_INTERIOR_DESIGN.pdf).
